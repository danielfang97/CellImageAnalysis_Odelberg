# CellImageAnalysis_Odelberg

This public repository is used to store the two Matlab files containing the code used to analyze the confocal images used in our lab's projects.
It contains two files at this moment: the data calculation file and the GUI file. 
The two files are titled: "CalculateCellsForGUI" and "CalculateCellsGUI". The other files are uploaded for relevance.
This code uses a lot of the image visualization toolbox in Matlab. 
This repository was created for the purpose of transparency for project submission. 

# Instructions for use of the GUI:
Add both files to either the Matlab folder or the correct PATH. 
Add image files to the same folder. Or, the path to the image files can be added.
Open the GUI. 
Because of the nature of our project, there are 3 main images to upload.
1. The full image, 2. single color 1 image, 3. single color 2 image
Change the name of the file if necessary.
Click save.
Select the nickname in the drop down menu. 
Adjust wanted threshold level. Default is 0.1.
Click calculate. 
Record results.

# Future changes:
Can save the Matlab data information to the PC.

Contact either the Odelberg Lab or the repository owner for more information.
